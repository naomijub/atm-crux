**The main idea was to use a challange to implement a transistor example**
* This uses Crux as database.
* This was translated by google translate.
* I did not really care about delivering the exact problem, I created and App instead of Api.


# IBM ATM Challenge
You create an ATM API (APP), where it is possible to execute withdrawal, deposit, transfer, extract and production of a lockout report, in addition to operations and controls that must be used.

* For operations to be available or to be opened, opening and closing operations must be provided.

Withdraw

* For withdrawal operations, the necessary data must be informed as input to the operation, and returned as bank notes that will be removed from the box, in addition to the additional data if necessary.

Deposit

* For deposit operations, the necessary data must be informed as input of the operation, in addition to the type of deposit (MONEY, CHECK) and return the tracked data to the receipt.

Transfer

* For transfer operations, the data necessary for the operation of the source and destination accounts must be given, with balance validation parameters and the possibility of scheduling.
